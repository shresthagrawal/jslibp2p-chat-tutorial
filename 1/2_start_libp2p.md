## Starting our Libp2p node

Now since we have configured the transport, we can start our libp2p node by calling `libp2p.start()` inside the main.

### Your Turn

- Start the libp2p node using `await libp2p.start()` inside the main.
- Console log `Libp2p Started` after the node is successfully up.

> Tip - For those running locally, you should be able to see the log started by libp2p.

This successfully concludes Chapter 1 of our quest to create a js-libp2p-chat tutorial. See you in the next chapter!
