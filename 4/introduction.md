# What is Peer Discovery?

Peer Discovery is one of the most important components in a decentralised system. As explained before, a peer-to-peer is a computer network, commonly referred to as an **overlay network**, built on top of an existing network, usually the Internet. Peer discovery is the process of routing through the network by hopping from peer to peer in order to find information.

# Why is Peer Discovery so important?

This method of using a network overlay has the advantages of being highly scalable and robust, avoiding a single-point of failure. In order for this to work, peers must know the IP addresses of the underlying network of the other peers they are trying to interact with. Therefore, some type of discovery mechanism or protocol is needed to create and maintain the connections between peers. [FIX some type of centrally available point is really needed, even if it only plays an introductory role.]
